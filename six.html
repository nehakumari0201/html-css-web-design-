			 <dd>Computers enable marketing campaigns to be more precise through the analysis and manipulation of data.
			 They facilitate the creation of websites and promotional materials. They can be used to generate social media campaigns.
			 They enable direct communication with customers through email and online chat.</dd>

		     <dt>Science</dt>
			 <dd>Scientists were one of the first groups to adopt computers as a work tool. 
			 In science, computers can be used for research, sharing information with other specialists both locally and internationally,
			 as well as collecting, categorizing, analyzing, and storing data. Computers also play a vital role in launching, controlling, and maintaining space craft, 
			 as well as operating other advanced technology.
           </dd>

		     <dt> Publishing</dt>
			 <dd>Computers can be used to design pretty much any type of publication.
			 These might include newsletters, marketing materials, fashion magazines, novels, or newspapers.
			 Computers are used in the publishing of both hard-copy and e-books. They are also used to market publications and track sales.</dd>

		     <dt>Arts and Entertainment</dt>
			 <dd>Computers are now used in virtually every branch of the arts, as well as in the wider entertainment industry.
			 Computers can be used to create drawings, graphic designs, and paintings. They can be used to edit, copy, send, and print photographs. They can be used by writers to create and edit. They can be used to make, record, edit, play, and listen to music. 
			 They can be used to capture, edit and watch videos. They can be used for playing games.</dd>

		     <dt>Communication</dt>
			 <dd>Computers have made real-time communication over the internet easy, thanks to software and videoconferencing services such as Skype. Families can connect with audio and video, businesses can hold meetings between remote participants, and news organizations can interview people without the need for a film crew. Modern computers usually have microphones and webcams built-in nowadays to facilitate software like Skype.
			 Older communications technologies such as email are also still used widely.</dd>

		     <dt> Weather Forecasting</dt>
			 <dd>The world's weather is complex and depends upon a multitude of factors that are constantly changing. 
			 It's impossible for human beings to monitor and process all the information coming in from satellite and other technologies, never mind perform the complex calculations that are needed to predict what is likely to happen in the future.
			 Computers can process the large amounts of meteorological information.</dd>
		 </dl>
		  <dl>  
		     <dt>Robotics</dt>
			 <dd>Robotics is an expanding area of technology which combines computers with science and engineering to produce machines that 
			 can either replace humans, or do specific jobs that humans are unable to do. One of the first use of robotics was in manufacturing to build cars. Since then, robots have been developed to explore areas where conditions are too harsh for humans, to help law enforcement, to help the military, and to assist healthcare professionals.
